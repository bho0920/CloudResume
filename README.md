# My Personal Cloud Resume Website

This is my personal cloud resume website, designed and developed by me to showcase my skills and experience. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and is hosted on AWS services such as S3 (static hosting), CloudFront (CDN), and Route 53 (DNS) using DynamoDB, Lambda, IAM roles.

Feel free to explore the code to see how I built the site!

**Note**: Sensitive deployment details (e.g., bucket names, secrets) are not included for security reasons.
